QUESTIONS ATTEMPTED:

Question 1: Personal Bio Card
Question 2: Simple Calculator
Question 3: String Manipulator
Question 4: Age Calculator
Question 5: Bill Splitter
Question 6: Grade Calculator
Question 7: Temperature Converter
Question 8: Leap Year Checker
Question 9: Ticket Pricing System
Question 10: Simple ATM Simulator
Question 11: Number Pattern Printer
Question 12: Multiplication Table Generator
Question 13: Sum and Average Calculator
Question 14: Factorial Calculator

SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS:

1.Each question was implemented as a separate function for clarity and modularity.
2.The if __name__ == "__main__": block was used to ensure programs run only when executed directly.
3.Input values were taken using input() and converted into appropriate data types (int, float).
4.Exception handling (try-except) was used in some programs to handle invalid inputs.
5.Mathematical operations were implemented using:
   Built-in functions like sum(), max(), min()
   math module for prime checking
6.Loop structures were used for:
   Pattern printing
   ATM menu system
   Temperature conversion menu
   Multiplication table
7.Logical conditions were used for:
  Leap year checking
  Grade calculation
  Ticket pricing rules
  Minimum balance validation in ATM


CHALLENGES FACED:
1.Handling invalid user inputs (e.g., entering text instead of numbers).
2.Managing logical conditions properly in programs like:
   Leap Year Checker
   Ticket Pricing
   Grade Calculator
3.Ensuring correct loop structure in pattern programs.
4.Maintaining minimum balance condition in ATM simulator.
5.Avoiding division by zero errors in calculator and bill splitter.
5.Understanding nested loops for pattern printing.
7.Implementing mathematical logic for:
   Prime checking
   Fibonacci sequence
   GCD and LCM
